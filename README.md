# Clojurescript App using an importmap

This app demonstrates using 3rd party npm libraries (e.g. React) which are downloaded directly from the browser, as opposed to being downloaded and bundled at build time.

The actual app is just the [tanstack react-router 'quick-start'](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/quick-start) in cljs.

# Usage
